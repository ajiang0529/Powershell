# Powershell

Implemented with C. Include use of boolean operations, pipes, and file redirection. Essentially a Windows Powershell mimic. This shell can process linux
commands like cat, ls, cd, a.out, exit, tmp, etc. This powershell could also handle compound commands linked with &&(and) and |(pipes).
The design revolved around a binary search tree structure with specific algorithms which traverse the tree a specific way based on and's and pipes.
